# QuickSwitch
QuickSwitch plugin for UnityEditor
## Description
QuickSwitch allows you to minimize any EditorWindow to the floating panel  
Use **[Alt+PageDown]** to minimize  
Or use **[Window/QuickSwitch/Settings]** to set up auto-minimization behaviour  
To restore window click or focus its minimized tab (**[Ctrl+Tab]**)
## Limitations
Beware that window settings resets after minimization. I couldn't find a way of saving their settings prior to minimization.  
Windows could be truly minimized and hidden offscreen but it breaks ctrl-tab switching and creates redundant windows after restart.
